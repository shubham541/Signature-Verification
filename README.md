# Signature-Verification
In this project we have implemented offline system of signature detection. Before implementing the  algorithm, pre-processing of a scanned image is necessary to isolate the signature part and to remove  any noise present. The objective of this project is proposing a feature vector of an offline handwritten  signature by using an efficient algorithm as a strong feature extraction namely Histogram Orientation  Gradient (HOG), in order to be passed into Artificial Neural Network for the recognition operation. An  experiment has been conducted to estimate the accuracy and performance of the proposed algorithm  by using local database, which has more than 48 genuine and 48 forged signature samples taken from  4 individuals. The result has given accuracy as 96.8% as successful rate coming from the error type as:  False Accept Rate (FAR) is 3% and False Reject Rate (FRR) is 3.35%.
